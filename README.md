# Exposure Factor (EF) Estimation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on estimating the **Exposure Factor (EF)**, a key element of the **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)** formula in cybersecurity risk management.  
Traditional EF estimation often relies on subjective judgment. This project proposes a **semi-quantitative approach** that integrates empirical data to provide a more objective and reliable estimation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Move beyond subjective EF estimation.
- Leverage real-world datasets and predictive metrics.
- Provide a reproducible Python-based framework for EF calculation.

## 🛠️ Features
- Integration with **vulnerability databases** (e.g., NVD for CVEs).
- Use of **exploit prediction metrics** such as:
  - **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)
  - **KEV** (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)
  - **LEV** (Likelihood of Exploitation Value)
- Assessment of security impact based on the **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
- Automated calculation of EF values.
